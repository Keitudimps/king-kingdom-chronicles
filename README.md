# King Kingdom Chronicles â€“ Author Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This project is about creating a **portfolio website for an author**. The goal was to design and build a clean, modern, and responsive site that highlights the authorâ€™s biography, books, and a way for readers or collaborators to connect.  

For my chosen author, I focused on **Stephen King**, one of the most influential writers in modern literature.  

The design and development process followed the proposal guidelines for a minimalist, professional website, with inspiration drawn from premium portfolio layouts. I also used **Lovable AI** to support parts of the development and streamline the design process.
